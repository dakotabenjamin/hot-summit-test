In the nascent stages of the West Africa Ebola outbreak in March 2014, very little of the affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia - was mapped. The unprecedented size and geographic range of this outbreak created huge logistical and epidemiological restraints on responders. Within a few months West Africa was mapped by over 3,500 volunteers around the world. Response organizations, such as the Red Cross and MSF began using the information in OpenStreetMap daily to locate existing hospitals and newly built Emergency Treatment Centers, for offline navigation, and to track the outbreak in real time. Detailed, accurate maps created from OSM allowed responders to track location data collected on Ebola patients and their contacts. This panel will discuss how OSM in a humanitarian response can be used beyond just navigation, but for operational planning and analysis as well.
