"Data is key to spatial information. Its availability, accessibility, accuracy and affordability are always a challenge in developing parts of the world. At eHealth Africa, a foremost health care and public health access support organization, the importance of spatial data could not be overemphasised. This presentation will showcase what eHealth Africa has been able to achieve using OSM and discuss mapping in Nigeria as a whole and eHealth Africa's successes in Kano State specifically.
