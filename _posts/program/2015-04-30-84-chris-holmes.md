Planet Labs is a new startup with a bold mission: To image the entire planet every day. In the last year alone the company has built and launched 87 satellites, which are successfully imaging at 3-5 meter resolution. The goal is not only to increase awareness of our planet but also to enable greater responsiveness to everything that affects it. Chris serves as Product Architect, guiding Planet's technology to make it as easy as possible to access the data and take action. Chris was previously founder of OpenGeo, and serves on the boards of the Open Geospatial Consortium and Brave New Software. He will give an overview of the mission and technology of Planet Labs, and talk through potential collaboration points with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.
