The Imagery Coordination group participates in helping find and process pre- and post-disaster imagery through the NextView and other license arrangements. Coordination has happened through a mix of Google group discussions, maps, coordination apps, and Github. This session will be a facilitated discussion to review best practices, challenges and discuss coordination improvements. We will end the meeting with a list of next actions the group can use to further development of how HOT coordinates imagery requests.
