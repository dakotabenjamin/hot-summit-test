With the continued reduction in costs for small aerial vehicles and high resolution cameras, their use in crisis and humanitarian mapping has increased dramatically in recent years. Attendees will learn about the current state of sUAS technology and how they can be used to capture highly detailed imagery within days of an event for unparalleled accuracy and up-to-the-minute mapping and damage assessments.
